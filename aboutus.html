        <h1>About Our Civic Infrastructure Platform</h1>
        <p>Civic infrastructure plays a crucial role in ensuring a **smooth and functional society**. Unfortunately, many issues go **unresolved** due to **inefficient reporting systems and a lack of tracking mechanisms**.</p>

        <p>This platform helps citizens **report issues, track complaints, and receive timely updates** on their concerns. It serves as a bridge between the community and government services, making sure civic problems are addressed efficiently.</p>

        <h2>What Problems Can You Report?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity shortages, faulty transformers, and streetlight failures.</li>
            <li>Potholes, broken roads, and poor transportation infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Water supply issues, sewage leaks, and sanitation concerns.</li>
            <li>Garbage collection delays and improper waste management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>We aim to create a **faster and more accountable** civic complaint system to ensure that infrastructure problems do not disrupt daily life. **Your participation helps improve the city for everyone!**</p>
